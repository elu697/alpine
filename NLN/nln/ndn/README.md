# jNDN: A Named Data Networking client library for Java

**jNDN** is a new implementation of a Named Data Networking client library
written in Java. It is wire format compatible with the NDN-TLV encoding.

jNDN conforms to the NDN **Common Client Libraries API** and your application
should follow this public API: <https://named-data.net/doc/ndn-ccl-api/>.

## Installation

See the file [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for build and install instructions.

The library currently requires an external NDN daemon, and has been tested
with the [NFD forwarder](https://github.com/named-data/NFD).

## Reporting bugs

Please submit any bug reports or feature requests to the
[jNDN issue tracker](https://redmine.named-data.net/projects/jndn/issues).
